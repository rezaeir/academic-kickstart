# Less Eyestrain with [Dark Reader](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dark-reader/eimadpbcbfnmbkopoojfekhnkhdbieeh)

The Internet is white. You do a search on google, read a blog post, open youtube, open a journal website, or check social media. Most of them have light colors. So, let's enforce dark mode to have a more pleasing reading experience while browsing the net. The Dark Reader extension is the solution.

It has so many different options to change the colors into the most suitable for your needs. You can even change the fonts of the website and not just the colors. My favorite filter is Dynamic, which adapts to the website color palette.

# Better writing experience with [Grammarly](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/grammarly-for-chrome/kbfnbcaeplbcioakkpcpgfkobkghlhen)

I don't think there is any list of recommended chrome extensions without Grammarly. This is my most frequently used extension because I spend a large portion of my time writing emails, posts, questions, and answers. It was so useful that I bought the premium version, but the free one is also very functional. You can click the extension and write a new note or see your previous records. The most useful feature is that as you write on different websites, the extension starts working on your writing and gives you suggestions to improve it. It also has a built-in dictionary that you can activate in the extension settings and use it by double-clicking any word.

# Less open tabs with [OneTab](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/onetab/chphlpgkkbolifaimnlloiipkdnihall)

Most of us just start with the first chrome tab in the morning, and by the end of the day, the number of open tabs exceeds our system's capacity. Even if you have a robust system that doesn't lag after adding a few more tabs, it won't be clean. You can't also remember which one you should use when you need to go back to a previously open tab. So, without further explanation, just install the OneTab extension. Whenever you feel there are too many tabs open, click the extension icon and give you a descriptive list in one tab instead of all those tabs.

# Fast Calendar Check with [Google Calendar](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-calendar/gmbgaklkmjakoegficnlkhebmhkjfich)

There are so many times that I don't want to open the calendar, but I just want to get an instant view of my meetings for the next few days. This extension is precisely for this. You will see how many hours have remained until the next meeting/event in your calendar by looking at its icon. If you click on it, you will see a more complete view of your upcoming meetings.

# Check your Gmail with [Checker Plus for Gmail](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/checker-plus-for-gmail/oeopbcgkkoapgobdbedcemjljbihmemj)
![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/blM7642gQ1JCnpCN8StUjsNsNNL-sFmAGp5pfeEl6OZdQYuhdyHV2J_QL5CLYd_f4utv0AYJFg=w640-h400-e365)

I want to get notifications for my Gmail without depending on a desktop app. I also would like to get an instant view of my new emails without continually switching to a separate chrome tab for Gmail. So, this extension solves all these problems. You don't even need to sign in into each of your Gmail accounts separately, it automatically detects your accounts. You can also set it to just check the primary directory to prevent getting too many notifications for promotion and social emails.

# Save journal papers with [Zotero Connector](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/zotero-connector/ekhagklcjbdpajgpjgmbionohlpdbjgc)
![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/P-TYHROU9wzthXhmD3ywsYbDpoVe_wVdwXz4HfyULJfg-J54SG-WxAmhzNT6i3lzvUHhFiC5Rg=w640-h400-e365)

Zotero is a free reference manager software that is necessary for any student. This extension automatically detects the journal website, paper's pdf file, and its metadata. It saves it in the specified Zotero folder. Just open the journal page, open the Zotero desktop app, go to your desired folder in the app, and click the Zotero extension icon. It will save the paper's metadata and pdf file, if available.

# There are more extensions
I'm going to add more extensions to this list when I feel like it. If there is an extension which you like to add, let me know in the comments. If there is a better alternative to each one of these extensions, suggest it to me and I'll check it out.
