I just finished assembling, not buliding!!, my personal website, and this is the first post.

## My Personal Blog
This is my first post on my online website/journal. I still don't know how much activity, writing! I'm going to have in this place! But I'm excited about finally starting this project.

## How it began
This blog is **A Product of Solitude**, and the solitude is the consequence of me being in a _self-quarantine_ at home to prevent being infected by the **SARS-CoV-2** virus. Even though I wish the **COVID-19** situation finishes as soon as possible, because I have so many plans to get to, but I'm enjoying this isolation time because I'm an introvert!!

## What I'm going to write about
My formal scientific background is in **Molecular Biology** (MB), so I guess a significant portion of the posts will be on different MB sub-topics. However, I'm a big fan of **Programming** and **Mathematics**, and I'm continually learning, self-learning, new concepts in these fields. So, those will be two more subjects to talk about. There is one last thing, actually person!, that I'll talk about and he is **Alan Watts**, my long time role model. I guess the only reason that I came out of so many years of frustration and anxiety and came into peace with everything and everyone is him. There is no way I could even dare to have this peace of mind to learn so many different subjects without knowing him!
